/// The `number_to_words_nepali.dart` file contains the `NumberToWordsNepali` class, which
/// implements the conversion logic. This class can be used to convert integer numbers into
/// their Nepali word equivalents.
///
/// The `language.dart` file exports the `Language` enumeration, which defines the supported
/// languages for number-to-words conversion. The enum includes values for English and Nepali,
/// allowing users to specify the language in which they want the conversion to be performed.
